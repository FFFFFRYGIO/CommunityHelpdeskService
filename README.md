# Community Helpdesk Service

A Django web application, the Community Helpdesk Service enables the creation and review of posts containing guides and instructions. It is primarily aimed at instructors of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association (Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego) and individuals unfamiliar with computer and internet usage.

## Purpose of the Project

The main goal of this project is to create a space where users can acquire knowledge about computer handling and various software programs, thereby increasing their work efficiency and digital skills.

## Tech Stack and Development Environment

### Technology Stack:
- **Python** - backend programming language
- **Django** - Python web framework
- **PostgreSQL** - relational database system
- **HTML** - web content markup language
- **CSS** -  style sheet language for web design
- **Jinja2** - template engine for Python

- Model – Data management and structure.
- View – Application logic, HTTP request handling.
- Template – Website presentation, dynamic HTML.
